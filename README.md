### 6.final
- Reactive connection of push buttons to the LCD and moving a character on the LCD to the left and right, as well as displaying comparisons of the displacement compared to the initial position on 7 LEDs and subtracting 1 unit for moving to the left and adding a unit. for moving right to the number on the seven segment (the default number is 10)
